# avsdpll_study
- The Repository will give provide the details of week 3 letover which is essential to know before moving to any further training. The week 3 ingredients were essential and must not be weak for me. so here Let's break it down.
- This Verilog module, named `avsdpll`, models a simplified `digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO)` or `VCO-based PLL (Phase-Locked Loop)` in behavioral simulation. 
- It is not synthesizable, but it is useful for `simulation` of PLL-like behavior in testbenches.
  
✅ Module Ports

module avsdpll (
   output reg  CLK,     // Output clock signal generated by the VCO
   input  wire VCO_IN,  // Unused (possibly for extension)
   input  wire ENb_CP,  // Unused (possibly for extension)
   input  wire ENb_VCO, // Active-low enable for the VCO
   input  wire REF      // Reference clock input
);

| Signal   | Direction | Purpose                                           |
|----------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| CLK      | output    | The output clock generated by the VCO            |
| VCO_IN   | input     | Not used in current implementation (might be for future use) |
| ENb_CP   | input     | Not used in current implementation (could control charge pump?) |
| ENb_VCO  | input     | Enable for the VCO (active-low, so 0 enables it) |
| REF      | input     | Reference clock input for adjusting the VCO output frequency |

✅ Internal Variables

```verilog
real period, lastedge, refpd;
```
- **period**: Current period of the output `CLK` signal (in nanoseconds).
- **lastedge**: Timestamp of the last rising edge on `REF`.
- **refpd**: Reference clock period (time between consecutive rising edges on `REF`).
